After cloning this repo, from your terminal, cd into the repo directory.
Then type this into the terminal
```
./setup.rb
```
The script that runs will ask you for your codd username. Enter it, and a file, `sync.rb`, will be generated for you.

When you want to push up all the contents of the `/app` sub-directory, just call the sync script:
```
./sync.rb
```
It will as you for your codd password. Enter it, then check your codd page at
